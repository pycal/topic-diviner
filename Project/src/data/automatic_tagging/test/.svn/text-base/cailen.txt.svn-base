POL486/2205 Research ProposalResearch QuestionCan cyber-warfare be a proxy to other types of military engagement? If so, what would make a state wish to engage in cyber-war?Central ThesisCyber-war is conducted in a new \"fifth dimension\", despite significant operational intersections with the four traditionally understood dimensions of conflict; land, sea, air, and space. The result is the possibility for new types of attacks which have an asymmetric \"risk to reward\" ratio, where the potential destruction caused is high, and the risks to the attacker are few and of decidedly lower probability than those risks associated with other types of attacks. As a result, cyber-warfare can be a limited and desirable proxy to more open types of warfare.Semantic and Definitional Arguments Differentiating Cyber-Warfare From Information WarfareInformation Warfare (IW) has been a popular subject of study since the 1970s, and has gained much scholarship especially in the last decade. IW as a term is often conflated in the modern dialogue with topics like network-centric warfare and cyber-warfare, but in fact it is as old as warfare itself, and is a concept with rigorous theoretical foundations. For that reason it is an important first exercise to examine the bounds of IW. The operational definition that this research project will adopt is that of the United States Air Force (USAF) in Cornerstones of Information Warfare: \"Information Warfare is any action to Deny, Exploit, Corrupt or Destroy the enemy’s information and its functions; protecting ourselves against those actions and exploiting our own military information functions.\"The USAF Cornerstones can be applied to historical examples dating through thousands of years of warfare, but important developments in international affairs in June 2010 are not fully encapsulated within IW theory. Specifically, a computer worm and corruption-type attack named Stuxnet was discovered, which had the intent of causing real physical damage by way of altering operational machine instructions of critical industrial systems. Such a cyber-attack goes beyond the definitional confines of IW, and makes clear the need to distinguish that not all cyber-warfare is Information Warfare. The aforementioned USAF Cornerstones are intention-based bounds of IW that describe military information operations, and an attack meant to destroy infrastructure is beyond its scope despite any dependencies it might have on military intelligence gained through IW. Cyber-warfare is therefore more correctly understood as a new dimension of warfare, albeit with significant intersections with IW.Why Cyber-war has been used as Proxy to Other Forms of Military Engagement, and Why We Should Expect it to be Used Increasingly SoVarious asymmetries can exist that will affect the strategy and scope of cyber-warfare that a state will want to engage in. Examples include the technology base and human capital available, and the likelihood that a cyber-attack will elicit a reprisal from the target state or group. Until recently, media attention has been focused on various instances of a type of cyber-attack called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), which is meant to impair network operations and is readily traceable. But what Stuxnet made obvious is that a cyber-attack could be conducted with such low traceability as to make a response extremely hard to justify to the international community. Cyber-warfare provides a new toolkit for conducting offensive military operations, and some of the more covert tools will allow states to engage in much more limited warfare than was previously available.
